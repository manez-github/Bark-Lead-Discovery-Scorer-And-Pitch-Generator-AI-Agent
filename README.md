An autonomous AI agent that logs into **Bark.com** via Google OAuth, scrapes buyer leads, scores them against an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) using an LLM, and generates personalized pitches for high-quality leads — all without human intervention.

## ✨ What It Does

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Launches a real browser and logs into Bark.com via **Google OAuth** |
| 2 | Scrapes all available leads from the seller dashboard |
| 3 | Scores each lead **(0.0 → 1.0)** against a predefined ICP using an LLM |
| 4 | Generates a personalized **3-paragraph pitch** for every lead scoring ≥ 0.8 |
| 5 | Saves everything to a local JSON database, skipping duplicates on future runs |
| 6 | Runs in a loop — automatically re-checks for new leads every **6 hours** |

---

## ✨ Features

- **Persistent Browser Session**: Uses Playwright's `launch_persistent_context` to store cookies, cache, local storage, and a full browser profile on disk — making the session indistinguishable from a legitimate returning user to Google's bot-detection systems.
- **Human-like Automation**: Implements randomized delays, character-by-character typing, and smooth mouse movements to mimic real human input patterns.
- **Intelligent Lead Scoring**: Utilizes an LLM to score leads based on a strict logic hierarchy (Budget overrides vs. Perfect Fit exceptions).
- **Automated Pitch Generation**: Generates 3-paragraph personalized cold outreach messages for qualified leads.
- **Graph-Based Architecture**: Built with LangGraph for robust state management and workflow orchestration.

## 🧠 Customization

Edit `graph/prompts.py` to tailor the agent's behavior:

- **`ICP_DESCRIPTION`**: Change the Ideal Customer Profile to target different project types, industries, or budget ranges.
- **`PITCH_PROMPT`**: Adjust the tone, structure, or length of the generated cold outreach messages.

## 🔄 How the Agent Pipeline Works

The agent follows a directed graph defined in `graph.py`:
```
Init → Auth Check → [Login] → Scraper → Analyst → Pitch Generator → Close
```

| Step | Node | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Init** | Launches a Chromium browser with a persistent context (saving session to `./browser_data`) |
| 2 | **Auth Check** | Navigates to `bark.com/login` to verify if the user is already logged in |
| 3 | **Login** | If not logged in, performs a human-like Google OAuth login flow |
| 4 | **Scraper** | Navigates to the Sellers Dashboard, scrolls to load all leads, extracts Name, Budget, Category, and Q&A, then saves new leads to `data/leads.json` |
| 5 | **Analyst** | Reads unanalyzed leads and scores them (0.0–1.0) using an LLM with ICP logic |
| 6 | **Pitch Generator** | Creates a personalized 3-paragraph pitch for leads scoring `> 0.8` |
| 7 | **Close** | Safely closes the browser context and stops Playwright |

</div>

- `auth_check` routes to `login` or directly to `scraper` depending on session state
- `analyst` routes to `pitcher` if qualified leads exist, or `close` if none
- The persistent browser context in `browser_data/` stores your session so **login only happens once**
- After each full cycle, the agent sleeps for **6 hours** before running again

---

## 🎯 Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

The agent scores leads based on the following criteria (defined in `prompts.py`):

- **📌 Project Type:** E-commerce, Custom Web App, or Bespoke Design. Rejects bug fixes and maintenance.
- **🏢 Business Type:** Established businesses. Rejects students and hobbyists.
- **💰 Budget Logic:**
  - Budget ≥ £999 → ✅ auto-qualify regardless of other factors
  - Perfect project + business type match → ✅ qualify regardless of budget
  - Otherwise → minimum **£750** required

---

## 📊 Lead Status Flow

Each lead in `leads.json` moves through these statuses:

```
🆕 NEW  →  🔍 ANALYZED  →  ✍️ PITCHED
```

> Duplicate leads are detected using a composite ID and skipped automatically.

## ⚠️ Anti-Detection Measures

### 🗂️ Persistent Browser Context

This is the most critical anti-detection mechanism in the project.

When Playwright launches a **normal browser context**, it creates a completely fresh, ephemeral session — no cookies, no cache, no local storage, no browsing history. Google and other platforms actively flag these sessions as suspicious because:

- No cookies means no prior session history with Google's servers
- Empty local storage means no saved preferences, tokens, or user fingerprints
- No cache means every asset is fetched fresh — atypical of a real returning user
- No browser profile data on disk — bots rarely persist data between sessions

Google's bot-detection systems (used during the OAuth login flow) check for all of the above. A clean-slate browser is a strong signal of automation.

**`launch_persistent_context`** solves this by saving the following to a directory on disk (`./browser_data/`):

| Data Type | What It Stores | Why It Matters to Google |
|---|---|---|
| **Cookies** | Session tokens, `GAPS`, `SIDCC`, `__Secure-1PSID` etc. | Proves prior authenticated sessions with Google |
| **Local Storage** | User preferences, app state, tokens | Indicates a returning, familiar browser environment |
| **Cache** | Previously fetched assets (JS, images, fonts) | Mimics a browser that has visited the site before |
| **IndexedDB** | Structured app data stored by web apps | Present in all real browsers that have used Google services |
| **Service Workers** | Background sync and push notification data | Absent in fresh contexts; present in real browsers |
| **Browser Profile on Disk** | The existence of a `browser_data/` folder on the filesystem | Google checks whether browser data is physically stored on disk — a legitimate user's browser always has a profile directory |

The mere existence of a populated profile directory on disk is itself a trust signal. Real users' browsers always have data saved locally. An ephemeral context with nothing on disk is a textbook bot fingerprint.

After the **first successful manual login**, all of this data is saved automatically to `./browser_data/`. Every subsequent run reuses this profile, making the browser appear as a legitimate returning user rather than a fresh automated session.

### 🤖 Human Behaviour Simulation

Beyond the browser context, the following helper functions in `utils/helpers.py` simulate real human interaction patterns at the input level:

- Random delays between all actions (`human_delay`)
- Character-by-character typing with variable speed (`human_type`)
- Smooth mouse movements impersonating an actual human moving the mouse (`human_mouse_move`)
- Real Chromium browser with a legitimate user agent string
- Windows sleep prevention via `keep_awake()` so long runs are uninterrupted
